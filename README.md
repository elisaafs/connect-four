# Connect Four

*Connect Four* is a browser two-player game in which the players first choose a color and then take turns dropping one colored disc from the top into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. 

The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own discs. 

Because of the 2018 World Cup, the game was styled with soccer theme.
